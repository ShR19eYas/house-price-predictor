🏠 #House Price Predictor

A machine learning–based web application that predicts house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant parameters. The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Streamlit.

🚀 #Features

End-to-end machine learning pipeline

User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit

Trained regression model for accurate price prediction

Modular and clean project structure

Ready for cloud deployment

🛠️ #Tech Stack

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas & NumPy

Streamlit (for web interface)

Heroku (used earlier for deployment)

Pickle (model serialization)

▶️ #How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ShR19eYas/house-price-predictor.git
cd house-price-predictor


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

🌐 #Deployment

The application was previously deployed using Heroku

Deployment was discontinued due to platform pricing changes

The project remains fully deployment-ready and can be hosted on platforms like:

Streamlit Community Cloud

Render

Railway
