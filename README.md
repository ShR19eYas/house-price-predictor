# 🏠 House Price Predictor 💰

A machine learning–based web application that predicts house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant parameters.  
This project demonstrates a complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Streamlit.
